But rather than sticking to the same class structure\r\nit was decided to use [stream buffers](http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/streambufs.html)\r\nin C++ standard library.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration to derive from std::streambuf came from the [socket++](http://www.linuxhacker.at/socketxx)\r\nlibrary initially developed by Gnanasekaran Swaminathan. While the\r\nsocket++ library seems to be stable and feature rich, the coding style\r\nand the lack of API documentation makes it a little difficult for the\r\nbeginners.\r\n\r\npsocksxx library attempts to borrow the concepts from socket++ and\r\nsocket-library, but not the code, and create a well documented (and\r\nhopefully easy to understand) POSIX socket communication wrapper in\r\nC++. To keep the code simple and clean this project will only support\r\nPOSIX sockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\nYou can download source distributions from https://github.com/nukedzn/psocksxx/releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Debian/Ubuntu packages\r\n\r\n\t$ sudo aptitude update\r\n\t$ sudo aptitude install libpsocksxx-dev\r\n\r\n*Note:* Check availability for your distribution first ([Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=psocksxx), [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=wily&section=all&arch=any&keywords=psocksxx&searchon=names)).\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n* CppUnit >= 1.12.1 (for unit tests)\r\n* Doxygen (for doxygen documentation, of course)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugs and Feature Requests\r\n\r\nPlease report all bugs and feature requests under [issues](https://github.com/nukedzn/psocksxx/issues).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version history\r\n\r\n__0.0.6__ - _03rd October 2014_\r\n*   Removing obsolete doxygen tags\r\n\r\n__0.0.5__ - _29th June 2014_\r\n*   Fixing inconsistent timeout behaviour on different systems\r\n\r\n__0.0.4__ - _10th November 2013_\r\n*   bug fix - member functions should not be throwing exceptions if the\r\n\tsignature does not specify it.\r\n\r\n__0.0.3__ - _31st October 2013_\r\n*   Suppress SIGPIPE signals\r\n*   Code cleanup work\r\n\r\n__0.0.2__ - _29th September 2013_\r\n*   Added timeout support for socket communications\r\n*   New base socket stream I/O class to reduce redundant code\r\n*   Added install targets for doxygen generated docs\r\n\r\n__0.0.1__ - _19th September 2013_\r\n*   Initial release\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compiling from source\r\n\r\nIf you are using the github source then first you need to initialise\r\nautotools.\r\n\r\n\t$ libtoolize (glibtoolize in OS X)\r\n\t$ aclocal\r\n\t$ autoheader\r\n\t$ autoconf\r\n\t$ automake --add-missing (you will need automake >= 1.13)\r\n\r\nAfter that you can use the usual `./configure && make`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n#### Doxygen documentation\r\n\r\nThe latest doxygen documentation can be found at http://jenkins.geniusse.com/job/psocksxx/doxygen/.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
